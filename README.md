# Hello-World
Hi! My name is Jasmine Roland and I am currently a freshman at Virginia State UNiversity.
I am majoring in computerscience and cybersecurity hoping to eventually get my masters in both.
At the moment I know the programming languages python and java but am definetly looking forward to learning even more.
